Q.3 
You are given a linked list where:

Each node has two pointers:
 
next → points to the next list

bottom → points to a sorted sub-list

All individual lists are sorted

Task

Flatten the linked list so that:

All nodes appear in a single sorted list

The flattened list uses bottom pointers only

next pointers should be ignored in the final list

✅ Approach (Using Min Heap)

Traverse the entire linked list using next and bottom

Store all node values in a PriorityQueue (Min Heap)

Extract elements one by one from the heap

Create a new sorted linked list using bottom pointers

This approach is easy to understand and avoids complex pointer manipulation.

-----code in java------
class Solution {
    public Node flatten(Node root) {

        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        Node temp = root;

        // Step 1: Collect all values
        while (temp != null) {
            pq.add(temp.data);
            Node curr = temp.bottom;
            while (curr != null) {
                pq.add(curr.data);
                curr = curr.bottom;
            }
            temp = temp.next;
        }

        // Step 2: Build flattened list using bottom pointer
        Node dummy = new Node(0);
        Node tail = dummy;

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            tail.bottom = new Node(pq.poll());
            tail = tail.bottom;
        }

        return dummy.bottom;
    }
}
